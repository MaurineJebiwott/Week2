        <h2>History</h2>

         <p>Nestled in the heart of a historic district, Ember & Thyme began as a humble family-run eatery in 1985. Originally a small bakery known for its wood-fired bread and herbal-infused dishes, it quickly became a local favorite. Over the years, the restaurant expanded its menu, blending traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques. The name Ember & Thyme reflects its roots—honoring the warmth of the fire that has cooked its meals for decades and the fragrant herbs that define its signature dishes. Today, it stands as a beloved dining spot, preserving its rustic charm while offering a refined farm-to-table experience.</p>
